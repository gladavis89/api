# api

this project was built to learn how to use an api and implement that api's information to the DOM

ive commented most of my code so anyone who would like a very beginners perspective can do so and understand what is happening

this project uses some bootstrap and inline styling.

almost eveything on the page is generated using javascript with jQuery
